# Google Homepage
### Overview
 A basic mini-project to deconstruct and rebuild the Google.com homepage. This is my first project attempted as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript Series, found at the end of Web Developement 101 - The Front End - Project: HTML/CSS.

### Project Intent
Through this project I hope to solodify the new HTML and CSS skills we learned through The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Disgn unit, and other supplied resoures.
